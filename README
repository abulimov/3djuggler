You will need to implement internal website API, which supports following:
* /job. Depending on a POST params it should:
** Give a new job
** Give details about job
** Update job status
* /printer. Depending on a POST params it should:
** Refresh printer healthcheck
** Reschedule jobs

Every API call must send Username (app) and Password (token) as POST params
